Another attempt at writing blogs no one will read.

Over the years I have lost count of how many times I have tried to start a blog. Each time I assumed it would be easy to dash off a few casual notes, and each time the combination of perfectionism and real life got in the way.

This space is my latest, more realistic attempt: a quiet corner of the internet where I can capture learnings, half-formed ideas, and technical ramblings for my future self. If any of it turns out to be useful to other people, that is a welcome bonus rather than the main goal.
